                <h2>Shirtstuckedin: Keeping the old spirit of drifting alive</h2>  
                <p>Among the many startup automotive brands that have sprung up over the years, supplying car enthusiasts with racing gloves, t-shirts, bumper stickers and various other motorsport memorabilia, Shirtstuckedin stands out as truly inspired by drifting culture. The company, founded by Australian native Casey Dhnaram, not only sells shirts with the catchphrase "Have Fun Along The Way" but seems bound to the motto entirely. Shirtstuckedin's branding represents drifting in its truest form: form and function combined to create an incredibly entertaining experience. Along with apparel, Shirtstuckedin also sells car excessories including shiftknobs, floormats, racing seats and even an exhaust manifold for the SR20, in collaboration with Thirdstrike Fabrications.</p>
                <p>Casey's style carries from his brand to his workshop. Wanting to recreate what he'd experienced while viewing other automotive workshops and competition driftcars in Japan, Casey created a space that visitors would want to stay at, explore, and relax. The workshop itself is full of parts, merchandise, and colorful vibes and smells that represent the "in your face" style of the Japanese drift scene. It's great to see that not only is Shirtstuckedin a company focused on funding legitimate motorsport efforts, but is truly inspired by its fellow competitors as well.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Casey has a background in photography, and has worked for Streethunters in the past. His blog, which is archived back 15 years, is chalk full of incredible shots that represent Japan's drift scene. Nowadays, Casey focuses less on photography in order to fully dedicate himself to becoming a better driver. Getting sponsors is "difficult,"" Casey says, "Not to play the foreigner card, but it's difficult to do off your own two feet." In the motorsports world, gaining sponsors can be extremely helpful. Casey has been relying on building his own portfolio and proving himself as a driver to attain more sponsorships that can help him keep driving.</p>
                <p>Inspiration for Shirtstuckedin's product line can be found in 90's and 2000's Japanese tuner magazine scans, in which competition cars would use brightly colored wheels and aggressive liveries. Casey himself has collected quite a bit of rare parts over the years, even including the original SR20DE demo motor from Tomei, currently installed in one of his S13's. The motor was used to test new Tomei products over the years, and even includes a one-off exhaust manifold that helps produce the most amount of power possible from the DE.  </p>

                    <figcaption>The incredibly historied SR20 being tuned at PRO SHOP DIVERSION.</figcaption> 
                </figure>
                <p>It's truly inspiring seeing what Casey has done. Drifting is an incredibly fun sector of motorsport with a rich history, but those who truly dedicate themselves to it must endure the exhaustion and stress of supporting themselves. There is no underestimating the time and effor that goes into creating a brand like Shirtstuckedin, which stands for everything drifting is about: Having Fun Along The Way.
