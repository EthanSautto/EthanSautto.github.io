                    <h4>Supersprint Performance Muffler</h4>
                    <p class="description">This Supersprint performance exhaust for the M42 E30 318is gives a nice throaty and ripping sound. The Supersprint muffler is much freer-flowing than the stock exhaust which frees up horsepower in addition to improving the sound. This is a true cat-back system that bolts on to the stock catalytic converter and uses all of the same factory gaskets and hangers.</p>

                    <h4>ZHP Weighted Shiftknob</h4>
                    <p class="description">The Genuine BMW ZHP "Shorty" Shift Knob is a great addition to any BMW interior from 1982 onward. Yes, that's right; any BMW after 1982 can take advantage of this 5-speed ZHP-style shift knob. The knob sits much lower than the factory knob and is weighted for smoother engagement, making it an excellent addition to any short shift kit or even on its own. The knob has an M-inspired shift pattern with an alloy base collar for an ultra-clean "OE Plus" look.  Aside from the feel, the best feature of this knob is that it pops into place just as a factory knob should - no generic set screws!</p>

                    <h4>Supersprint Exhaust Headers</h4>
                    <p class="description">This header system features an X-pipe after the headers to improve exhaust flow and scavenging. The X-pipe helps the exhaust gas mix and then flow into the rest of the exhaust. This header system has a bend in the outlets from the X-pipe to fit to the stock E30 catalytic converter (cut the stock E30 downpipes and these clamp in place). This makes them a direct swap from the stock manifolds and downpipes and an easy fitment for E30s with the stock exhaust.</p>
